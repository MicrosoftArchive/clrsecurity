# Security.Cryptography.OidGroup

{"The OidGroup enumeration has values for each of the built in Windows groups that OIDs can be categorized into."} 

| AllGroups | {"When used for searching for or enumerating over OIDs, specifies that the search or enumeration should include OIDs found in all of the groups."}  |
| HashAlgorithm | {"A group for OIDs that represent hashing algortihms. This maps to the native CRYPT_HASH_ALG_OID_GROUP_ID group."}  |
| EncryptionAlgorithm | {"A group for OIDs that represent symmetric encryption algorithms. This maps to the native CRYPT_ENCRYPT_ALG_OID_GROUP_ID group."}  |
| PublicKeyAlgorithm | {"A group for OIDs that represent asymmetric encryption algorithms. This maps to the native CRYPT_PUBKEY_ALG_OID_GROUP_ID group."}  |
| SignatureAlgorithm | {"A group for OIDs that represent digital signature algorithms. This maps to the native CRYPT_SIGN_ALG_OID_GROUP_ID group."}  |
| Attribute | {"A group for OIDs that represent RDN attributes. This maps to the native CRYPT_RDN_ATTR_OID_GROUP_ID group."}  |
| ExtensionOrAttribute | {"A group for OIDs that represent X.509 certificate extensions or attributes. This maps to the native CRYPT_EXT_OR_ATTR_OID_GROUP_ID group."}  |
